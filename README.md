# scraping_youtube_subtitles
 I have scraped a list of 500 videos from a Brazilian youtuber to count the words he used more often

Check the code [here](https://github.com/luizftoledo/counting_youtube_words/blob/main/o_que_diz_caue_moura_no_youtube.ipynb)
See the a list of the words ranked by frequency [here](https://github.com/luizftoledo/counting_youtube_words/blob/main/caue_final.csv)
